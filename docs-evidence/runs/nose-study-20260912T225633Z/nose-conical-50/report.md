No case is ranked or cleared for flight. Dummy and provisional actual loads use the same mass and CG.

## Warnings and failures

- empty-C5-3-wind0: no engine warnings
- empty-C5-3-wind2: no engine warnings
- dummy-C5-3-wind0: no engine warnings
- dummy-C5-3-wind2: no engine warnings
- actual-C5-3-wind0: no engine warnings
- actual-C5-3-wind2: no engine warnings

## Missing measurements / physical checks

- Exact XIAO board/camera/antenna identity and measured envelope
- Battery identity, connector/wire envelopes and retention measurements
- Measured mass and balance: BT-60 cardboard airframe
- Measured mass and balance: 18 mm motor mount tube, thrust ring, hook, two centering rings and adhesive
- Measured mass and balance: Nominal 457 mm parachute and lines
- Measured mass and balance: Kevlar leader, elastic harness, swivel and knots
- Measured mass and balance: Recovery wadding
- Measured mass and balance: Two paper launch lugs and adhesive
- Measured mass and balance: Bulkhead eye bolt, washers, nuts, sled screws and cable ties
- Measured mass and balance: Fin collar adhesive and tapered lip fillet
- Measured mass and balance: Flame-resistant bay shield and perimeter seal allowance
- Assembled mass/CG, print fit, attachment strength and recovery separation checks
- V2 saddle bond strength and adhesive mass require physical checks; saddle-specific aerodynamic drag is unresolved

- actual-C5-3-wind2: no numeric criterion failures; consult warnings and missing inputs

## Assumptions and boundaries

- Length origin: nose tip, +x aft; CAD +Z maps to axial +x. Flight position: OpenRocket local east/north/up, SI units.
- ISA atmosphere, constant wind at every height, zero turbulence; configured seed is retained. Displacement is
  scenario-dependent.
- Native OpenRocket aerodynamics; conical nose, cylindrical sections, three flat trapezoidal fins and tapered collar
  fairing. The thin fairing lip/glue fillet is an approximation documented in BUILD.md.
- CAD volume × material density is a solid-mass estimate. Nose/bay/sled lumped mass and CG; fin mass included once in
  collar override.
- No external camera/antenna is modeled. Configuration rejects protrusions. An internal camera has no guaranteed useful
  view.
- Stability minimum is sampled from guide departure strictly before apogee or deployment, whichever comes first, using
  (CP−CG)/reference diameter. Low-speed samples remain included; time, speed and angle at the minimum are in JSON.
- Event metrics interpolate adjacent samples at the engine event time. Landing descent is vertical speed at ground
  event, not a structural impact assessment.
- Recovery is motor-ejection deployment with configured Cd; packing envelope, ejection seal, thermal protection and
  attachment loads require physical checks.
- Reference mode preserves upstream geometry and masses; demonstration CAD and baseline mass assumptions do not apply to
  that reference.

## Configured criteria

- apogee_m: 30.0 … 120.0 m; engineering assumption; Project engineering assumption for demonstration screening; not a
  launch clearance
- guide_departure_m_s: 12.0 … None m/s; engineering assumption; Project engineering assumption for demonstration
  screening; not a launch clearance
- minimum_ascent_stability_cal: 1.0 … None cal; engineering assumption; Project engineering assumption for demonstration
  screening; not a launch clearance
- deployment_speed_m_s: None … 10.0 m/s; engineering assumption; Project engineering assumption for demonstration
  screening; not a launch clearance
- landing_descent_m_s: None … 6.0 m/s; engineering assumption; Project engineering assumption for demonstration
  screening; not a launch clearance
